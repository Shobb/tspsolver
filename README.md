Data and docs related to TspSolver

TspSolver - is a software for solving traveling salesman problem.

It is published in Windows Store - https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PHQJQQDQGZ0 .

It can work in two modes - heuristic solver based on genetic algorithm and in exact mode -
using MIP solver, which can use results of heuristics algorithm as initial solution. 

This gives opportunity to solve exactly instances up to 200 cities in reasonable time.

Input and output data - in Excel format.

This repository contains input matrices - in directory Data, and some exact solutions - in directory
Solutions. All solutions are obtained using above described method.
